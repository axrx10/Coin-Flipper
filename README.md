# Coin-Flipper


First self-made python program, flips a coin a certain amount of times (can be changed from the numOfFlips variable ) and produces the percentage and count. 
0 represents heads and 1 represents tails. it uses the random library to randomly choose between 1 and 0 (only integers obviously).
please tell me how i can improve this program or other things to add to it.
